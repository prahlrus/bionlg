This code is part of a framework for a Natural Language Generation system designed to produce natural-language text from a RDF triples encoding biographical data. It was written in Fall of 2012 at Grinnell College by William Prahl as part of a project with Dr John David Stone, Lecturer in Computer Science at Grinnell College.

The system was designed to use the Chinese Biographical Database (homepage: http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k16229&pageid=icb.page76535). This is a relational Microsoft Access database, so to use this system with it the CBDB must first be converted into RDF triples. For an explanation of how to do that, please see the README file included in the 'utilities' folder. For an explanation of how to use the system itself, see the README in the 'system' folder.
