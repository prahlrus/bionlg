These programs are utility programs for dealing with the Chinese Biographical Database. They are copyright December 2012 by William Prahl and John David Stone. 

To convert the CBDB into RDF, enter into one shell window

cat my_pipe | ./rdf_cleanup.rb > OUTPUT_FILENAME

And then enter into another shell window

./csv_to_rdf.rb DATA_PATH SCHEMATA_PATH

Where DATA_PATH is a path to the directory containing the CSV files and SCHEMATA_PATH is a path to a directory containing the RDF schemata files that the csvconverter uses.

To split an RDF file for use with the Biographical NLG system, pipe the file into rdf_splitter.rb with the command line argument of a path to the directory into which you want the data stored.
